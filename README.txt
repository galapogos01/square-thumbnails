A plugin for creating square thumbnails from images, without cropping them. It is very useful for for products images in woocommerce.

== Description ==

A plugin for creating square thumbnails from images, without cropping them. If the plugin is installed and activated, when you upload an image it will automatically create square thumbnails, for all sizes.
If you use a plugin to regenerate the thumbnails, the plugin will create square thumbanails for all existing images.
We needed this plugin to have square images not cropped for products in Woocommerce.

We are working on the following features:
    * Options to select the image sizes for which to crate square thumbnails
    * Image alignment in the square
    * Choosing background color or texture/image/transparent
    * Editor with many features for image editing
    * Many other interesting and useful features
